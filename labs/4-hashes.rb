# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 4-hashes.rb

# EXERCISE
# Ask the user for the current amount of Bitcoin that they own.
# Using the Ruby hash `bitcoin_data`, display a summary of
# Bitcoin data for the user. Something like the output below.

# Sample output:
# 1 Bitcoin is valued at $41405.1046 USD.
# Your Bitcoin is worth $62107.6569.

# 1. Get input from a user using gets.chomp.
puts "How much bitcoin do you have?"
bitcoin = gets.chomp

# 2. The value will be a string, so you'll want to convert it to a Float.
bitcoin = bitcoin.to_f

# 3. inspect the bitcoin_data hash
# puts bitcoin_data

# each bitcoin worth
each_bitcoin = bitcoin_data["bpi"]["USD"]["rate_float"]
# puts each_bitcoin

# your bitcoin value
your_value = bitcoin * each_bitcoin

# write how much bitcoin you own
puts "You have #{bitcoin} bitcoin"

# write how much 1 bitcoin's value
puts "1 Bitcoin is valued at $#{each_bitcoin} USD"

# write how much your bitcoins' value
puts "Your Bitcoin is worth $#{your_value} USD"
